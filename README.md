# laddr

Laddr -- pronounced "ladder" and named after the essential tool for fire brigades -- is a web application designed to create an online home-base for [Code for America brigades](http://brigade.codeforamerica.org).

It provides a directory for members and projects, and activity feeds for posting updates and logging buzz for projects.

## Requirements
Laddr is built on the Emergence PHP framework and deployement engine, and requires an Emergence server to host it.

Emergence takes just a few minutes to setup on a Linux VM, and is designed to have a fresh system to itself. Once launched
it will configure services on the machine as-needed to host an instance of the application along with any other
sites, clones, or child sites. The guides for Ubuntu and Gentoo are most up-to-date: http://emr.ge/docs/setup

## Installation via Emergence (linked child)
-  Create an emergence site that extends http://MaPG1YxorgU6ew64@laddr.poplar.phl.io

## Installation from Git
-  Create an emergence site that extends http://8U6kydil36bl3vlJ@skeleton.emr.ge
-  Upload contents of git repository using WebDAV client (CyberDuck is the best open-source option)
